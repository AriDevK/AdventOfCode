This day obviously is harder than the first one, but it's still easy. I even took my time to refactor my own code and make it more readable. I'm happy with the results.

I think that is a good problem with some edge cases to have in mind (some of them even are improbable almost on my input)

But well, have a nice day and see you tomorrow :3

### Take a look to the problems and my results:
