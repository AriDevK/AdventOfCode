This is my second year doing the Advent of Code; the last year I didnt go far enough, but this year I'm going to try to finish it. I'm going to start directly with C# because I'm more comfortable with it, but I'm going to try to do it with other languages as well.

At this moment this how we go:

| Day | Part |  Technology | Spent time | Feeling  |      Notes       |
|:---:|:----:|:---:|:----------:|:--------:|:----------------:|
|  1  |  1   | C# |    15 m    |    ⭐     |       easy       |
|  1  |  2   | C# |   5m   |    😎    |  GG IZZY  |
|  2  |  1   | C# |    49m    |    🪄     |       Linq did its magic       |
|  2  |  2   | C# |   47m   |    💪🏻    |  BRUTE FORCE!! (just a little hehe)  |
