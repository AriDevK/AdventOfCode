This day was pretty much easier than the last year; honestly I didnt want to code anything today but then I remember that "DUDE IT'S DECEMBER....DO THE ADVENT!!" so here I am haha

This problem took me around 20 minutes and didn't have to do too many things to solve it properly, I doesnt even took time to play some music, just read the problem and type the answer xD
