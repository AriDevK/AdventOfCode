This day was so much easier than the previous one.
Literally, It's just read properly the input and do some math.

Today I also do it in Go so I'm happy :D

Looking at my Wakatime stats, I'm spent 1h 30m on this problem. (could be less but on the first part I was adding the NON POSSIBLE instead of the POSSIBLE OMFG I'm so freaking stupid)

(Kinda cringy write this while im listening vocaloid songs? idk but heres the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpXYV3EdxBY enjoy it uwu)
