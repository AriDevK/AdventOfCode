This day was literally the most difficult day until today, 
I spent like 2 or 3 days solving just the second part ._.

I'm so happy that I finally solved it, but honestly, I'm not proud of my code, it's so ugly and I don't like it.

Please don't look at it, I'm so ashamed of it; literally is one of those codes that you write just to finish the work and 
says "later I will refactor it" but you never do it. 

But well... I already do the day 4 part one but I'm a little stuck on part two, but it seems to bee EASIER than this one.



I'm gonna add an anime girl here just to be happy uwu
