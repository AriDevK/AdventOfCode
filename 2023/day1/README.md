This day was pretty easy the first part, but omg the second was something LITERALLY didnt let met sleep well,
it's really tricky because has edge conditions that you need to implement tricky and unclean solutions to completed
(not just me, I look at reddit a lot of people suffering with this problem and its tricky solution .-.)

Otherwise, I completed these the morning of second day and spent like 2 hours to solve this

(help me god this should be a chill day **cries on bread with butter)
